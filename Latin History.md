### Introduction

$\quad\quad$ Alternative hypothesis to genetic relevance: _chance similarity_, _linguistic borrowing_, _linguistic convergence_.

An example of "ne med malos tatod"

### 1.2 The IE language family

###### Anatolian

$\quad\quad$ _Hittite_, attested in the cuneiform script, the ancient Near East, dating from the 16th century BC. Palaic and Luwian attested in cuneiform, the latter also in hieroglyphic. Later in alphabetic scripts, including Lydian, Lycian and Carian.

###### Greek

$\quad\quad$ Second earliest attested, in Linear B syllabary, 14th Century BC.

###### Indo-Iranian

Indic: 2000 BC in cuneiform, major early: hymns of the Rg-Veda.

Iranian: Zarathrustra in the Avesta, around 1000 BC for the composition of the Gathas and several centuries earlier for the oldest Vedic hymns.

$\quad\quad$ Indo-Iranian, Greek and Anatolian are the three most important brances for the reconstruction of PIE.

###### Latin and the language of Italy

_Latino-Faliscan_: Faliscan 7th-6th century BC
_Sabellian group_: Oscan and Umbrian, 6th century BC
_Venetic_: 6th century BC
_Messapic languages_: greater divergence

###### Celtic

Only irish, Scots Gaelic, Welsh and Breton surviving.

$\quad\quad$ Earliest attestations around the beginning of the Christian era.
Old Irish: 7th century AD

Subgroups: Goidelic, Brythonic, Celtiberian, Gaulish, Lepontic
It's not sure whether a continental Celtic actually reflects any linguistic reality.

######German

1000 BC, the first extensive text is the Gothic Bible translation

Old English 8th century, Old HG, Old Saxon and Old Norse the following century

###### Armenian

5th century AD Bible

###### Slavic

9th century Bible

###### Baltic

Lithunian, Latvian and Old Prussian 14-16th centuries written

###### Albanian

attested in texts from the late Middle Ages to the early modern period

### 1.3 Reconstructed PIE

Assumption: a single language was spoken at some point in time from which all the different IE varieties have evolved.

$\quad\quad$ The __Comparative Method__ operates through identification of sets of correspondence in languages which are known to be related, and forming of hypotheses to explain the correspondence.

$\quad\quad$ It is more likely that the reconstructed items are diffusely arraved in time and space and acrosss the speaker population.

### 1.4 Latin and IE

PIE

###### Phonology

$\quad\quad$ Consonats

|  Stops |

| Labial | Dental | Palatal | Velar | Labio-velar |
| ------ | ------ | ------- | ----- | ----------- |
| *p     | *t     | *k`     | *k    | *k^w^       |
| *b     | *d     | *g'     | *g    | *g^w^       |
| *b^h^  | *d^h^  | *g'^h^  | *g^h^ | *g^wh^      |

Fricatives: *s
Laryngeals: *h~1~, *h~2~, *h~3~
Nasals: *m, *n
Continuants: *r, *l, *y, *w

Vowels:

​	*e, *o, *a, *i, *u and their long counterparts
*m, *n, *r, *l as vowels

$\quad\quad$ Labio-velar in Eastern IE (Indo-Aryan, Iranian, Slavic, Baltic, Armenian) as velars or palatized velars, in WIE (Greek, Germanic, Celtic, Latin) as velars with concomitant lip-rounding or sometimes as labials

In Latin, qu- comes from *k^w^, but g^w^ continued by w but also b (as in _bos_, normally explained as borrowings)

$\quad\quad$ voiced aspirates: voiceless aspirates in Greek, voiced aspirates in Sanskrit, voiced in Germanic, Iranian, Armenian, Baltic and Slavonic.

In Latin, fricatives in word-initial, voiced stops word-medially

$\quad\quad$ Laryngeals: trace left only in the Anatolian branch.

V+H results in long vowels except for -eH
eh~1~> Latin ē, Greek ē, Sanskrit ā
eh~2~> Latin ā, Greek ā/ē, Sanskrit ā
eh~3~> Latin ō, Greek ō, Sanskrit ā

before vowels they are generally lost except for He-
h~1~e>Latin e, Greek e, Sanskrit a
h~2~e> Latin a, Greek a, Sanskrit a
h~3~e> Latin o, Greek o, Sanskrit a

Between consonants
Ch~1~C> Latin a, Greek e, Sanskrit i, other IE branches a or lost
Ch~2~C> Latin a, Greek a, same as above
Ch~3~C> Latin a, Greek o, same as above
In Latin, vocalic m n r l developped to em, en, or ,ol respectively.

###### Latin morphosyntactic developments from PIE

$\quad\quad$ __Ablaut(vowel gradation)__ in PIE

1. Quantative ablaut: shift of word-accent within paradigm with a concomitant loss of the unaccented vowel
2. Qualitative ablaut: vowel quality change within the same syllable

*e / *o or *e/zero alternation

The example of _melior_: how ablaut disappeared from PIE to Latin

###### Nominal Declensions

\in The confusion of instrumental and ablative, the overlap between _origin_ of the ablative and _path_ of the instrumental,denoted by the old ablative marker
-e in the 3rd declension may originate from the old locative *-i

\in Besides dual, PIE may have a separate "collective", taking the ending of the neuter plural.
e.g. locus, loca, alongside locus, loci
	adjective in concord with two conjoined inanimate nouns of differing gender is inflected as neuter
