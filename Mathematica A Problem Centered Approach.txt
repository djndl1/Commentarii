# Mathematica: A Problem Centered Approach

## 1. Introduction

```mathematica
Block[
    {$MaxExtraPrecision=500},
    statement
]

Parametric[]: plots the graph of the function dependent on other parameters
ContourPlot[]: Find all the points which satisfy the equation
PlotPoints->: may be added to create a finer, more detailed plot
RevolutionPlot3D{}: rotate a function around a axis
```

###### Handling Data

```mathematica
Table[]: creates a loop
TableView[]: view in a table
TableForm[]
Export[]: export the data
```

$\quad\quad$*Mathematica* provides built-in functions to access data on U.S. and other stocks, mutual funds and other financial instruments, as well as indices, and currency exchange rates.*Mathematica* provides built-in functions to access data on U.S. and other stocks, mutual funds and other financial instruments, as well as indices, and currency exchange rates.

###### LInear Algebra

```mathematica
/.: ReplaceAll
Show[]: 
MatrixForm
@:Prefix
//:Postfix
/@:Map
```

###### Calculus

```mathematica
D[]
FullSimplify[]
Integrate[]
Exclusions: is an option that specifies where to exclude in regions used by functions like Plot, Plot3D, and NIntegrate.
Nintegrate[]: gives a number approximation to the integral
```

##2. Basics

\in*Mathematica* is not approaching the expressions numerically.

```mathematica
?Command ??Command
TrigExpand[]: expands out trigonometric functions
E^ instead Exp[] is much handier.
(* comment *)
%: previous output
%%: the second previous output and so on
n!
FactorInteger[]
Prime[]: produces the n-th prime number
NextPrime[]: gives the next prime larger
(*the set of prime numbers is infinite*)
PrimePi[]: gives the number of primes \[Pi](x) less than or equal to x
LCM[]: least common multiple
Mod[m,n]: gives the remainder on division of m by n
Quotient[m,n]: m=qn+r, finds q
Binomial[]
Alt+: stops the evaluation or Quit Kernel
Together[expr]: puts terms in a sum over a common denominator, and cancels factors in the result. 
Apart[]: the inverse of Together
TrigExpand[]
TrigFactor[]
Degree: Sin[30 Degree]
(*In Mathematica, the underscore is reserved and will be used in the definition of functions*)
Clear[]: clear a variable
Clear["Global'*"]: clear all values and definitions
(*Assigning a value to a symbol works globally. That means, if you open a new NoteBook, the values given to variables in a previous NoteBook still exist.*)
```

###### Dynamic Variables

```mathematica
Dynamic[x]
Slider[]
Manipulate[]
```
