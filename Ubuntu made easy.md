_Distributions/distros_: Linux system and application collections. the core operating system (that’s the Linux kernel I mentioned earlier); some sort of installer program to get all the system parts and applications properly installed on your machine; the X Window System to provide graphical interface support; one or more graphical desktop environments; and a series of applications, such as word processors, audio players, and games.

\indUbuntu is based on the Debian distribution, which means that it utilizes Debian’s very convenient DEB package system for application handling and installation. The graphical package installer that comes with Ubuntu, Ubuntu Software Center, makes installing those applications even easier.

Installing Ubuntu Inside Windows (the Wubi Installer),it doesn’t give you the full experience you would get from a dedicated Ubuntu installation. It’s not as robust as a full Ubuntu installation, and it takes longer to install because Wubi needs to download the installation files from the Internet (the right ones aren’t on the CD).
